## Terragrunt Configuration
Terragrunt is used to stop the replication of provider, backend and module code.

The backend (remote_state) configuration is included from the parent directory's terragrunt.hcl in each child directory of the environement (for example: uat/webpage/terragrunt.hcl)

The provider configuration is generated for each child directory from the parent directory's terragrunt.hcl. This generated file can be found under .terragrunt_cache.
